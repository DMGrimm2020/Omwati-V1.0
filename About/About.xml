	This mod depends on the alien race framework by Erdelf. You can view its original post here https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=839005762, but at the time of the writing of this post the release is on beta 18 while 1.0 is required. You can obtain 1.0 on their github https://github.com/erdelf/AlienRaces/releases. Until Erdelf updates versioning the 1.0 does work just ignore the fact that it is red in the mod list.
